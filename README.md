## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Single File Application** - Everything contained in `index.html`
- **No External Dependencies** - Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Client-Side Storage** - Data stored in memory (resets on page refresh)
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

### Data Storage
Currently uses in-memory storage. For persistent data, consider:
- **Local Storage** - Browser-based storage (data persists locally)
- **Firebase** - Real-time database integration
- **REST API** - Connect to your existing backend
- **GitHub Issues API** - Use GitHub as a backend

### Security Considerations
- No user authentication (add as needed)
- Client-side only (data not encrypted)
- Input validation for XSS prevention

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Free Hosting
- **GitHub Pages** - Perfect for static hosting
- **Netlify** - Automatic deployments with form handling
- **Vercel** - Fast deployments with custom domains
- **Surge.sh** - Simple command-line deployments

### Self-Hosted
- Any web server (Apache, Nginx)
- Docker container
